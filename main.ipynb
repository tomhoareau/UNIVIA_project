    "En **superposant** ces distributions, on peut estimer la correspondance entre un score SAT et une **note théorique au Bac**. Cela se fait en considérant :\n",
    "1. La **forme générale** de chaque distribution (répartition et densité).\n",
    "2. Les **paliers de mention** au Baccalauréat (10, 12, 14, 16, etc.), croisés avec les **percentiles** du SAT.\n",
    "\n",
    "Le résultat se matérialise dans nos colonnes :\n",
    "- `low_grade_adjusted` et `high_grade_adjusted` qui fournissent une **approximation** du niveau de Bac correspondant à la fourchette SAT d’une université, tenant compte aussi de son **taux d’acceptation**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ainsi, un **score SAT élevé** associé à une **faible acceptance rate** peut « équivaloir » à une note supérieure à 15/20, par exemple. À l’inverse, des établissements moins exigeants se traduiront par des « notes de Bac » ajustées plus faibles.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Cette **conversion** offre un point de repère familier aux élèves et conseillers issus du système français.

    "- Cliquez sur les **universités** qui vous intéressent dans la liste,  \n",
